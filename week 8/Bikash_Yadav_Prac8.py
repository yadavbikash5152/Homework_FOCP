# f-strings: String formatting feature in Python, introduced in 3.6, allowing expressions inside curly braces within strings.
# Format Specifier: Controls the formatting of values within strings, specified after a colon inside curly braces in an f-string.
# File Modes: Indicate the operations that can be performed on a file, such as read ('r'), write ('w'), or append ('a').
# Binary Files: Handling non-text data in files by opening them in binary mode ('b'), commonly used for images or executables.
# Random Access: Refers to the ability to access data at any position in a file, facilitated by methods like seek().
# Exceptions: Events that disrupt the normal flow of a program, handled using try, except, else, and finally blocks for error management.
