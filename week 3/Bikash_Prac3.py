# A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either True or False.

# Relational operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them.

# Logical operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.

# Operator chaining refers to the ability to use multiple operators in a single expression.

# The ternary operator is a concise way to write an if-else statement in a single line.

# Iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a block of code.

# A nested loop is a loop inside another loop.
